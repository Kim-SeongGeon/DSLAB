Currently, the map in Mission Planner uses the 2025 Google Map.

However, when zoomed in, the image becomes too pixelated to be practical for use with actual robots.  
Therefore, we are considering using **Google Earth** instead.

Currently, the map in Mission Planner displays a red aircraft icon.  
However, since our research focuses on ground robots, we wanted to change the icon to one that better suits our application.

We searched through all the image files in both the Mission Planner and ArduPilot directories we downloaded, but couldn't find the relevant icon file.  
As a result, we posted a question on the ArduPilot community site and received help from other users:
